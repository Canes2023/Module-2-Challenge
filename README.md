# Module-2-Challenge

For my module 2 challenge, I was tasked with creating a portfolio with the same sections and navigation links as in the mockup provided by the instructor. I created a portfolio website that contains my module 1 challenge, an about me, contact me, work, and resume navigation links. Please note that the Resume link does not work as I haven't added my Resume to the portfolio. I'm not sure it's qualified for professional use just yet. For Project 1, when you click on the image of the project, you will be redirected to the website that contains the altered code. The website is also 98% optimized for mobile read. The contact me page is a little wacky and needs adjustments. The navigation links at the top of the page all work and take you where you need to go (except for Resume as mentioned earlier why it doesn't work). There is a contact me section that contains my info and a footer with my name at the bottom. 

Code Source came from me and partially from help from Professors. Location of the code is on the main branch of the repository.
